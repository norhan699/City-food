Italian cuisine includes deeply rooted traditions common to the whole country, as well as all the regional gastronomies,
 different from each other, especially between the north and the south of Italy, which are in continuous exchange.Many dishes 
 that were once regional have proliferated with variations throughout the country.Italian cuisine offers an abundance of taste,
 and is one of the most popular and copied around the world.
 The cuisine has influenced several other cuisines around the world, chiefly that of the United States.<br/><br/>
One of the main characteristics of Italian cuisine is its simplicity, with many dishes made up of few ingredients,
 and therefore Italian cooks often rely on the quality of the ingredients, rather than the complexity of preparation.
 Italian cuisine is at the origin of a turnover of more than â‚¬200 billion worldwide.<br/><br/>
The most popular dishes and recipes, over the centuries, have often been created by ordinary people more so than by chefs, 
which is why many Italian recipes are suitable for home and daily cooking, respecting regional specificities, 
privileging only raw materials and ingredients from the region of origin of the dish and preserving its seasonality
