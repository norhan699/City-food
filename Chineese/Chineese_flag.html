Chinese cuisine is an important part of Chinese culture and includes cuisines originating from China. Because of the Chinese diaspora and historical power<br/>
 of the country, Chinese cuisine has influenced many other cuisines in Asia and beyond, with modifications made to cater to local palates. Chinese food 
 staples <br/>such as rice, soy sauce, noodles, tea, chili oil, and tofu, and utensils such as chopsticks and the wok, can now be found worldwide.
<br/><br/><br/>
The preferences for seasoning and cooking techniques of Chinese provinces depend on differences in historical background and ethnic groups. 
Geographic <br/>features including mountains, rivers, forests, and deserts also have a strong effect on the local available ingredients, considering
 that the climate of <br/>China varies from tropical in the south to subarctic in the northeast. Imperial royal and noble preference also plays a role
 in the change of Chinese cuisine.<br/> Because of imperial expansion and trading, ingredients and cooking techniques from other cultures have been integrated 
 into Chinese cuisines over time.
